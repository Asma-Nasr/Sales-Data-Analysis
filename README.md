# Sales Data Analysis

This repository contains my implementation of the Sales Data Analysis task provided by Intern2Grow as part of their Data Analyst Virtual Internship Program.

## Task Overview

As part of the internship, I was required to analyze a small dataset of products and answer a set of questions using my data analysis skills. Below are the details of the task.

### Task 1: Sales Data Analysis

You were given a dataset containing information about sales made by a fictional company over the course of a year. The dataset is in the file `sales_data.csv` and includes the following columns:

- **date**: The date of the sale (in YYYY-MM-DD format)
- **product**: The name of the product sold
- **category**: The category of the product (e.g., "electronics", "clothing", etc.)
- **price**: The price of the product (in USD)
- **quantity**: The quantity of the product sold
- **revenue**: The total revenue generated by the sale (i.e., price * quantity)

### Questions to Answer

For this analysis, I addressed the following questions:

1. What was the total revenue generated by the company over the course of the year?
2. Which product had the highest revenue? How much revenue did it generate?
3. What was the average price of a product sold by the company?
4. What was the total quantity of products sold by the company?
5. Which category had the highest revenue? How much revenue did it generate?
6. What was the average revenue per sale?
7. What was the total revenue generated in each quarter of the year (i.e., Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4)?

### Implementation

- The analysis was performed using a Jupyter Notebook, which is included in this repository as `sales data analysis.ipynb`.
- The final report summarizing the analysis and findings is provided in the `report_sales.pdf` file.

### Submission Instructions

This repository serves as the submission for the task. It includes the dataset, analysis code, and the final report.

Thank you for the opportunity to complete this task, and I look forward to further feedback!
